# Surfs Up Weather Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to review weather patterns in Hawaii to determine the feasibleness of opening a surf and icecream shop in that location. This project focused on the weather temperatures in June and December. The idea was to compare varying stastical data between the two periods to assess whether the shop would have enough good weather conditions in which to operate.

## Results

The following table summarizes June's temperature statistics over several years:

The next table summarizes December's temperature statistics over several years:

These two tables tell us about the differing weather patterns for the two monthly periods. Some takeaways:
1.	Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively, show a moderate temperature and very little fluctuation between the two periods from an average standpoint.
2.	the maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are also remarkable similar.
3.	the minimum temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June) show the greatest variance, and reflects a much lower temperature level in December that may not be conducive to ice cream or surfing. However, with standard deviations of 3.25 (June) and 3.74 (December) we would expect a little more variation in the december numbers.

## Summary

Overall the weather in December and June are historically very similar, although December has a wider range of results, with its high being close to June's but its low well below June's.

Additional queries that could be run include: Precipation difference between June and December to determine is one has more rainy weather, as well as a comaparison by weather station, as we may see higher/lower temperatures and precipitation levels at different locations. We would be primarily interested in the weather station closest to our prospective location, which would narrow the results and provide the best data for us to consider
